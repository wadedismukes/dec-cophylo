    "# Prototyping simulation study using DEC model for Cophylogeny\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a basic run through of the workflow that will be used to perform simulations for testing the usefulness of utilizing the epoch-DEC model used in biogeography for examining cophylogeny. Here the dispersal part of this model corresponds to host-switching, the extirpation part to extinction of a symbiont within a host, and the cladogenesis part the various sorting events occuring when the host speciates (including cospeciation). The hosts here act as the biogeographic areas upon which the symbionts live. For now I am testing this using only true trees simulated using [`treeducken`](https://github.com/wadedismukes/treeducken). While these simulations will reflect a mode of gene and spceies tree evolution and are thus not the most biologically realistic way to test this model, I think this is a good starting place. Especially with regards to comparing these models to other methods for examining cophylogeny. \n",

    "### Functions for making `treeducken` settings files\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few functions used to make the settings files for treeducken. For now I am varying only transfer rate with 12 extant tips. The first of these functions `calculate_birth_rate` calculates the birth rate for a number of extant tips, given an expected tree depth, and turnover rate. This allows all of the simulation regimes to have roughly the same timescale upon which they act. The last two functions in this codeblock are simply utilities for generating the settings files. "
