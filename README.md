# dec-cophylo
Repo for working on using DEC-epoch model for cophylogeny analyses. Currently using Rmarkdown to show the workflow.

The Rmd notebook called `dec-cophylo-pipeline.Rmd` will walk you through the workflow for running the simulations in treeducken.

The scripts for running the simulation output in revbayes can be found in `rev-scripts`
